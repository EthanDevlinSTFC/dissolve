# Comparing Benzene Structure

## 8. Calculate Refined Properties

We now have our refined simulation that is in better agreement with the experimental data, so its time to recalculate our properties so that we can compare them to those we saved earlier. All the processing layers should now be enabled and remain on for the production run, including the refinement layer.

> **Analysis** layer tab
{: .action .action_tabs}
> Enable the layer by clicking the ![](../icons/slider-off.png) button so it displays ![](../icons/slider-on.png)
{: .step}
> Simulation &#8680; Run For...
{: .action .action_menu}
> Enter 1000 and click _OK_
{: .action .action_edit}

If you're ready for another drink, now would be another opportune moment, or perhaps you could buy that thing you've been meaning to get from your favourite online retailer (no endorsements here!).

Once those iterations have completed, we can move on to do the comparison of the data. Also, we can snapshot our production run data:

> Simulation &#8680; Save Restart Point...
{: .action .action_menu}
> Change the filename to `production.restart` and click _Save_
{: .action .action_edit}
